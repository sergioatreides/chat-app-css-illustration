## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My second project giving preference to mobile first workflow.

It has been an intensive training in CSS but I did not read the "bonus" part until I finished the project. I leave it for a second version of the web, although I don't really understand what this "bonus" refers to and I don't even know if it can be done only with HTML and CSS (I haven't learned JS yet).

### Continued development

- Mobile first workflow.
- Responsive design.
- Autoprefixer.
